## New Java language features & updates and learning tools
Starting with the major release of Java SE 9+, each new six-month release of the JDK means that the programming language and virtual machine is quickly moving forward in order to cope with the rate of new technology innovation. 

Each version since Java SE 9, through Java SE 12, includes a bundle of changes, more library additions, new language features, and alterations to the JDK clean-up process.

This series takes you on an exploration of the most significant updates and changes to help you get ahead on the next iteration of Java coding.
